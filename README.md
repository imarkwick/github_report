#Github User Search

This week at Makers Academy we were introduced to AngularJS and SPAs.

The objective was to use the Github API to create a simple Github user search. In searching for a user, the result shows; 
- username, 
- avatar, 
- number of repos, 
- number of followers

The project includes building a simple Angular application that demonstrates two-way data-binding and dependency injection.

To view in the browser and search for Github users;

```sh
$ open index.html
```
