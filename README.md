# Github Report

This week at Makers Academy we were introduced to AJAX and SPAs.

## Objectives:

To use the Github API to create a simple Github user search app, purely in client side JavaScript. 

Searching for a user will show the following results; 
- username, 
- avatar, 
- number of repos, 
- number of followers

## Technologies used:

* Javscript
* AJAX
* HTML5
* CSS
* Sinatra
* jQuery
* Mustache
* GitHub api

## How to open in the browser:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/github_report.git
$ cd github_report
$ open index.html
```
